Hi, I'm a first-year MA student in the Department of Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, Canada. I'm an active member in [LangDev Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/langdev.html) and [Xsyn Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/xsyn.html).

I received my BA in English Linguistics & Literature at Ewha Womans University in 2024. Before coming to SFU, I worked with [Dr. Sujin Yang](https://cms.ewha.ac.kr/user/indexSub.action?codyMenuSeq=14826107&siteId=yanglab) and [Dr. Jinwook Choi](https://medinfolab.snu.ac.kr/member/index.html).
