Hi, I'm a first-year MA student in the Department of Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, Canada. I'm an active member in [LangDev Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/langdev.html) and [Xsyn Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/xsyn.html). 

I received my BA in English Linguistics & Literature at Ewha Womans University in 2024. Before coming to SFU, I was worked with [Dr. Sujin Yang](https://cms.ewha.ac.kr/user/indexSub.action?codyMenuSeq=14826107&siteId=yanglab) and [Dr. Jinwook Choi](https://medinfolab.snu.ac.kr/member/index.html). 

# You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
